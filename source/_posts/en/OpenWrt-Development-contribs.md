[What is OpenWrt ?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenWrt)

OpenWrt is an open-source project for embedded operating systems based on Linux, primarily used on embedded devices to route network traffic. The main components are Linux, util-linux, musl, and BusyBox. All components have been optimized to be small enough to fit into the limited storage and memory available in home routers	. 

What I have personnaly done to help OpenWrt better work with some softwares:
- SMStools
- Fail2Ban
- CrowdSec Agent, CrowdSec Firewall Bouncer
- ...
